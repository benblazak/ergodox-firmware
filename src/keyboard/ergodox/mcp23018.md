## Pinout and Pin assignments

* `+` indicates pin
* `o` indicates unused pin
* `-`s inserted between some of the pin functions for readability
* `OC**` pins enclosed in parenthesis had lines over them in the pinout

* notes:
    * Row and column assignments are to matrix positions, which may or may
      correspond to the physical position of the key: e.g. the key where `row4`
      and `column2` cross will be scanned into the matrix at `[4][2]`, wherever
      it happens to be located on the keyboard.  Mapping from one to the other
      (which only matters for defining layouts) is handled elsewhere.
    * ADDR (pin15): Set slave address to `0b0100000` by connecting to Vss(GND).
        * The user-defined bits are the three least significant
        * I2C addresses are 7 bits long (the last bit in the byte is used for
          indicating read/write)
    * RESET (pin16) must be externally biased.  Since we're not going to
      trigger it ourselves, we can tie it high.
        * This is not noted in the I2C Pinout Description section of the
          MCP23018 datasheet, but it's true (empirically), and it is noted in
          the SPI Pinout Description section, and in the MCP23017 datasheet.
        * I'm not the first person who's failed to notice ;)

## Notes about Registers

    register  address  function (for all bits)
    --------  -------  -----------------------
    IODIRA    0x00     \ 1: set corresponding pin as input
    IODIRB    0x01     / 0: set ................. as output
    GPPUA     0x0C     \ 1: set corresponding pin internal pull-up on
    GPPUB     0x0D     / 0: set .......................... pull-up off
    GPIOA     0x12     \ read: returns the value on the port
    GPIOB     0x13     / write: modifies the OLAT register
    OLATA     0x14     \ read: returns the value of this register
    OLATB     0x15     / write: modifies the output latches that control the
                                pins configured as output

* IOCON register (see datasheet section 1.6, table 1-5, register 1-8)
    * BANK: bit 7; read/write; default = 0
        * 1: The registers associated with each port are separated into
          different banks
        * 0: The registers are in the same bank (addresses are sequential)
    * SEQOP: bit 5; read/write; default = 0
        * 1: Sequential operation disabled, address pointer does not increment
        * 0: Sequential operation enabled, address pointer increments

* notes:
    * All addresses given for IOCON.BANK = 0, since that's the default value of
      the bit, and that's what we'll be using.
    * We want the column pins set as output high (hi-Z) without pull-ups
      initially, and the row pins set as input with pull-ups.  We'll cycle
      through driving the column pins low and checking the row pins in the
      update function.

* abbreviations:
    * IODIR = I/O Direction Register
    * IOCON = I/O Control Register
    * GPPU = GPIO Pull-Up Resistor Register
    * GPIO = General Purpose I/O Port Register
    * OLAT = Output Latch Register

    S  : Start       OP   : Device opcode
    SR : Restart     ADDR : Device address

    W  : Write       Din  : Data in to MCP23018
    R  : Read

    Byte and Sequential Write
    -------------------------
            Byte : S OP W ADDR --> Din --> P
      Sequential : S OP W ADDR --> Din ... Din --> P

    Byte and Sequential Read
    ------------------------
            Byte : S OP W ADDR --> SR OP R Dout --> P
      Sequential : S OP W ADDR --> SR OP R Dout ... Dout --> P

* notes:
    * We'll be using sequential mode (ICON.SEQOP = 0; default) (see datasheet
      section 1.3.1).
