# rev-2 (`partial-rewrite`)

This branch is currently under development, and all parts are subject to
change.  I'll do my very best to keep the latest commit working properly
though.

Source level documentation is being written with the code.  Other documentation
(including a better readme) will be written afterwards.

**Pull requests for this branch will almost certainly not be accepted at this
time.**  
Sorry.  It's a bit hard to explain exactly why.  Perhaps it will be
understandable if I just say that I've been working on this project for quite a
while now, and at this point rev-2 is kind of my baby.  One of my goals for it
is to not only have it work and have decent features, but be well designed and
well documented to the point that someone starting out where I did could pick
it up and learn without having to write their own.  Until it grows up, and I
send it out into the real world by moving it to the master branch, I'm likely
to feel very protective of it.

Notes:
* Gyuri Horak (dyuri) implemented NKRO and mouse keys in [his branch]
  (https://github.com/dyuri/ergodox-firmware) of rev-2.  Not merged, but I plan
  to implement the features later, if I can.  See [Pull Request #28]
  (https://github.com/benblazak/ergodox-firmware/pull/28).
* Oleg Kostyuk (cub-uanic) [ported the TMK firmware]
  (https://github.com/cub-uanic/tmk_keyboard)
  (written by "hasu") to the ErgoDox!

Status:
* School is starting again late August 2013.  It looks to be a busy semester,
  so I may not have that much time to work on it.  I wasn't able to get nearly
  the amount done this summer that I had hoped, other things taking precedence,
  but I still plan to finish everything I've already talked about: macro
  recording, (attempt) USB features, layout examples, and other documentation.
